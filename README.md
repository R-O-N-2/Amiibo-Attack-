# Basketball-Blitz!
A website for basketball fans to gather and research data.


Basketball Blitz is a site where basketball connoisseurs come to challenge their knowledge  about the National Basketball Association and its players / coaches.  Users have the ability to search any active player and their statistics while also having the option to compare that player to another. 

Using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and a public API I will construct the website using a search bar to get input with an abstract button that is encapsulated and also inherits properties that will cause the object to change its form making it polymorphic! q^_^p “alley-OOP!”

**TRIVIA GAME: random facts**
**livefeed of games with stats?**

- In HTML: place 2 search bars / buttons (input for each player) in their own divs to GET data and also display results once pulled (player photo and stats)
- In CSS: use styles to give the site a clean and crisp look. 
- In JS: use NBA API to make calls pulling the requested data and display it on site by referencing specific elements in HTML
