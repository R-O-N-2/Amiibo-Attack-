# Amiibo-Attack!
A website for amiibo fans to gather and research data.


Amiibo Attack is a site where amiibo connoisseurs come to challenge their knowledge  about various Nintendo Amiibos and their origin.  Users have the ability to search amiibos and view their origin date / game series while also having the option to compare that amiibo to another. 

Using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and a public API I will construct the website using a search bar to get input with an abstract button that is encapsulated and also inherits properties that will cause the object to change its form making it polymorphic! 


- In HTML: place 2 search bars / buttons (input for each amiibo) in their own divs to GET data and also display results once pulled (amiibo photo and info)
- In CSS: use styles to give the site a clean and crisp look. 
- In JS: use Amiibo API to make calls pulling the requested data and display it on site by referencing specific elements in HTML
